      "CONSIDERATION BY COURT\n",
      "Ground one\n",
      "We have carefully considered the application, the supporting affidavit,\n",
      "and the submissions made by Counsel for the Applicant. The first order\n",
      "sought in the application is for leave to be granted to the Applicant to\n",
      "file a supplementary record of appeal with additional evidence. The\n",
      "evidence in support of this ground is contained in paragraph  of the\n",
      "Affidavit in support of the application, reproduced above; in which the\n",
      "Applicant states that supplementary record of appeal sought to be\n",
      "allowed is the certified judgment of Madrama J in HCCS No.  of\n",
      ", which the Applicant contends relates to the same issues in the\n",
      "appeal; hence it is relevant, credible, and believable.\n",
      "It is manifest from this that the Applicant has brought this application\n",
      "for the admission of new evidence; but under an application for leave\n",
      "to file a supplementary record of appeal. This, we find to be irregular.\n",
      "Rule  () of the Rules of this Court provides that the record of appeal:\n",
      "“shall contain documents relating to proceedings in the trial court and\n",
      "shall also contain copies of the following documents relating to the\n",
      "appeal in the first appellate Court.”\n",
      "A supplementary record is record of what transpired in the lower Court\n",
      "but was excluded from the record of appeal filed in the appellate Court.\n",
      "It means the record of appeal filed in Court is defective or incomplete.\n",
      "In the instant case before us, the judgment sought to be admitted by\n",
      "way of supplementary record neither featured at the trial, nor at the\n",
      "Court of Appeal. Noticeably, whereas the rules of this Court provide,\n",
      "under r. , for supplementary records of appeal in civil appeals, the\n",
      "rules on criminal appeals have no such provision. The proper course of\n",
      "action learned counsel for the Appellant should have taken, was to\n",
      "apply for amendment of the memorandum of appeal instead of\n",
      "couching it under a supplementary record of appeal. We are not\n",
      "satisfied that there exists, any grounds for granting an order to file a\n",
      "supplementary record of appeal prayed for in the instant matter; and,\n",
      "accordingly, we decline to grant leave to file the supplementary record\n",
      "of appeal prayed for.\n",
      "Even if the Applicant had brought a proper application to admit new\n",
      "evidence under r. () of the Rules of this Court, it is clear from the\n",
      "evidence adduced and submissions made before this Court that the\n",
      "judgment sought to be admitted into evidence was available to the\n",
      "Applicant long before the Court of Appeal heard the appeal. The\n",
      "provision in Rule  that additional evidence is not admissible, is\n",
      "intended to ensure that litigation comes to an end; and the application\n",
      "of R.  () of the Rules of this Court which has a contrary import is only\n",
      "applicable in exceptional cases as laid down in the body of authorities\n",
      "cited herein.\n",
      "It should also be pointed out that there is a distinction between mistake\n",
      "of Counsel, and failure in judgment by Counsel on what course of action\n",
      "to take in the pursuit of the interest of the litigant who has instructed\n",
      "such Counsel. For the former, the position of the Courts is that such\n",
      "mistake or error should not be visited on the litigant. However, in the\n",
      "latter, the litigant pays the consequence of the ineptitude of or poor\n",
      "judgment by the Counsel.\n",
      "The rules governing admission of new evidence are well settled. In A.G\n",
      "v Paul K. SSemogere S.C Const. Appin No. of , Court laid down the test\n",
      "for admission of new evidence as follows:\n",
      "“()\n",
      "(iii)\n",
      "(iv)\n",
      "(vi)\n",
      "Discovery of new and important matters of evidence which, after the\n",
      "exercise of due diligence, was not within the knowledge of, or could\n",
      "not have been produced at the time of the suit or petition by, the\n",
      "party seeking to adduce the additional evidence;\n",
      "(ii) It must be evidence relevant to the issues;\n",
      "It must be evidence which is credible in the sense that it is capable\n",
      "of belief:\n",
      "The evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have\n",
      "influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive;\n",
      "(v) The affidavit in support of an application to admit additional\n",
      "evidence should have attached to it, proof of the evidence sought to\n",
      "be given;\n",
      "The application to admit additional evidence must be brought\n",
      "without undue delay.”\n",
      "The Court further made it clear that:\n",
      "“These have remained the stand taken by the courts, for obvious\n",
      "reasons that there would be no end to litigation unless a court can\n",
      "expect a party to put its full case before the court. We must stress\n",
      "that for the same reason, courts should be even more stringent to\n",
      "allow a party to adduce additional evidence to re-open a case, which\n",
      "has already been completed on appeal. The applicant's explanation\n",
      "why the additional evidence now sought to be admitted was not\n",
      "adduced at the trial of the petition or at the appeal to this Court is\n",
      "alleged negligence and incompetence of Mr. Dennis _Bireije,\n",
      "Commissioner for Civil Litigation in the applicant's chambers, who\n",
      "was one of the counsel who represented the applicant in both courts.\n",
      "To us, this means that the evidence was available and that with due\n",
      "diligence it could have been adduced at the trial of the petition or\n",
      "on the appeal to this court, but it was not... ... ...\n",
      "Lastly another factor we must take into account is that this\n",
      "application to admit additional evidence was brought several\n",
      "months after the appeal was completed. The judgments in the\n",
      "appeal were delivered on //, and this application was filed\n",
      "in Court on //.\n",
      "That was not bringing this application without undue delay.\n",
      "For these additional evidence in this case fulfills the special\n",
      "conditions we have referred to above. reasons, we are unable to say\n",
      "that the oral application to adduce It must therefore fail and it is\n",
      "accordingly dismissed with costs to the respondents.” (Our emphasis)\n",
      "It is quite evident that the Applicant is merely seeking to bring into\n",
      "contention before this Court the issue of the non-recusal by Justice\n",
      "Madrama from sitting on the appeal in the Court of Appeal; he having\n",
      "handled a civil matter the Applicant believes had biased his mind with\n",
      "regard to the matter before him on a criminal appeal. The law on recusal\n",
      "is provided for separately in the Constitution (Recusal of Judicial\n",
      "Officers) (Practice) Directions, . Recusal applications should be\n",
      "brought before Court at the earliest opportunity; which the Applicant\n",
      "herein failed to do. In the case of Baker v Quantum Clothing Group []\n",
      "EWCA Civ , Jacobs L.J noted that:\n",
      "“Finally, we think that this objection simply comes too late. It is not\n",
      "open to a party which thinks it has grounds for asking for recusal to\n",
      "take a leisurely approach to raising the objection. Applications for\n",
      "recusal go to the heart of the administration of justice and must be\n",
      "raised as soon as is practicable.\"\n",
      "We find the statement above to be good law. There is an obligation on\n",
      "a party who seeks to object, to make the application expeditiously. Any\n",
      "undue delay in bringing such an application will, in the eye of the law,\n",
      "amount to a waiver. According to Halsbury’s Laws of England Volume \n",
      "() th Edition, paragraph ;\n",
      "“The right to challenge proceedings conducted in breach of the rule\n",

      "nature of the disqualification and of his right to object and had an\n",
      "adequate opportunity of objecting. However, once these conditions\n",
